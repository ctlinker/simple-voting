# Note on PHP Extensions

## PHP Extensions

PHP extensions define what your `php` command can do, including which global functions and classes are available. They also allow you to add custom functions and classes that can be used in your PHP scripts.

Common PHP extensions include:

* **mysql**: MySQL client functions (deprecated in modern PHP versions; use `mysqli` or `PDO_MySQL` instead)
* **pdo**: PHP Data Objects (a database access abstraction layer)
* **pdo_mysql**: PDO driver for MySQL databases
* **iconv**: International character set conversion

…and many more.

Composer allows you to install libraries and manage dependencies for your PHP projects. Keep in mind that some libraries rely on specific PHP extensions to function properly.

Most PHP extensions are installed by default, but some may need to be installed manually. You can check which extensions are installed by running:

```bash
php -m
```

Some extensions may also need to be enabled in your `php.ini` file. The location of `php.ini` depends on your system:

* **Linux**:
  `/etc/php/7.4/cli/php.ini`
  `/etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini`
  `/etc/php/php.ini`

* **Windows**:
  `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`
  `C:\wamp\bin\php\php7.4.12\php.ini`
  `C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.4.12\php.ini`

* **macOS**:
  `/usr/local/etc/php/7.4/php.ini`
  `/usr/local/etc/php/php.ini`

If your project depends on a specific PHP extension, you can declare it in your `composer.json` file under the `require` section. For example:

```json
"require": {
    "ext-iconv": "*",
    "ext-gd": "*",
    "ext-mysqli": "*",
    "ext-openssl": "*",
    "ext-pdo": "*",
    "ext-pdo_mysql": "*"
}
```

This ensures that anyone installing your project via Composer will be notified if a required extension is missing.
